# PIDEs_Finite_Difference_methods

1) Jump_Diffusion_1D_v2

  Backward Time Central Space (BTCS) finite difference scheme for the PIDE for the survival probability under the one dimensional jump Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The jump is modelled by a simple Compound Poisson Process (CPP). 


2) Jump_Diffusion_RS_v2

  Backward Time Central Space (BTCS) finite difference scheme for the PIDE for the survival probability under the regime switching jump Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The jump is modelled by a simple Compound Poisson Process (CPP) and the regime-switch is modelled by a Continuous
  Time Markov Chain (CTMC). 
   

4) Jump_Diffusion_SV_v2

  Backward Time Central Space (BTCS) finite difference scheme for the PIDE for the survival probability under the one stochastic volatility jump Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The jump is modelled by a simple Compound Poisson Process (CPP) and the volatility is a continuous CIR-type
  process. The resulting coupled model is a Heston-type model.
